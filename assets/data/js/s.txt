Every Pytorch module begins with inheriting nn.Module. To make our framework as similar as possible, we will be implementing our own base nn.Module that we will be using for everything else to come! This is not that interesting a video, mostly just housekeeping and taking a look at what is going on inside frameworks like PyTorch!

(sorry for the slightly broken voice, had a bit of a sore throat!)
